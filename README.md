# ExceptionHandling
ExceptionHandling in java with six example programs
1. Design a class for a simple bank account. The class should have the following features:
         - Instance variables for the account holder's name, account number, and balance.
         - A constructor that allows the user to create an account with a given name, account number, and balance.
         - A method that allows the user to make a deposit to the account.
         - A method that allows the user to make a withdrawal from the account.
         - A method that returns the current balance of the account.
2. Design a class for a basic shape. The class should have the following features:
         - An instance variable for the shape's type (e.g. triangle, rectangle, circle).
         - An instance variable for the shape's dimensions (e.g. side lengths for a triangle, length and width for a rectangle, radius for a circle).
         - A constructor that allows the user to create a shape with a given type and dimensions.
         - A method that calculates and returns the perimeter of the shape.
         - A method that calculates and returns the area of the shape.
3. Design a class for a student at a school. The class should have the following features:
         - Instance variables for the student's name, grade level, and GPA.
         - A constructor that allows the user to create a student with a given name, grade level, and GPA.
         - A method that allows the user to update the student's GPA.
         - A method that returns the student's name and GPA as a string (e.g. ""John Doe has a 3.5 GPA"").
4. Design a class for a simple database connection pool. The class should have the following features:
    - A private constructor to prevent the class from being instantiated directly.
    - A static method that returns an instance of the class (following the singleton pattern).
    - A method that returns a new connection to the database.
    - A method that closes all open connections and releases them back to the pool.
5. Design a class for a basic point in 2D space. The class should have the following features:
    - Instance variables for the x and y coordinates of the point.
    - A constructor that allows the user to create a point with given x and y coordinates.
    - An equals method that returns true if the given object is a point with the same x and y coordinates, and false otherwise.
    - A clone method that creates and returns a new point with the same x and y coordinates as the original point.
6. Design a class for a basic credit card. The class should have the following features:
    - Instance variables for the cardholder's name, card number, and expiration date.
    - A constructor that allows the user to create a credit card with a given name, card number, and expiration date.
    - An equals method that returns true if the given object is a credit card with the same card number, and false otherwise.
    - A clone method that creates and returns a new credit card with the same name, card number, and expiration date as the original credit card."
